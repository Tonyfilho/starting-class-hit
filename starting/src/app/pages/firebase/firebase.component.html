      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Firebase</strong> is a platform developed by <strong>Google</strong> that provides a suite of backend services and tools
        to help developers build, improve, and grow their apps. It simplifies development by offering scalable infrastructure,
        authentication, hosting, databases, analytics, and more — all in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        When used with <strong>Angular</strong>, Firebase becomes a powerful full-stack solution for creating responsive, real-time,
        and secure web applications, with minimal server configuration.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Technologies Available in Firebase</h2>
      <p>The following Firebase services are commonly used in Angular projects:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>: Secure login systems using email, Google, Facebook, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Firestore</strong>: Real-time NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Hosting</strong>: Fast and secure web hosting for Angular apps, with free SSL and CDN.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Functions</strong>: Serverless backend (Cloud Functions) for running Node.js code on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Storage</strong>: File storage solution for images, videos, PDFs, etc., with secure access rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: App usage and behavior tracking integrated with Google Analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Messaging</strong>: Push notifications for web and mobile apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Performance Monitoring</strong>: Tools to measure and improve app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config</strong>: Dynamically change UI and behavior without redeploying code.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Use Firebase with Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        Angular provides a structured, component-based framework that aligns well with Firebase’s reactive, real-time services.
        This synergy allows you to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Build full-stack apps without setting up your own backend.</li>
        <li>Use real-time data syncing with minimal configuration.</li>
        <li>Deploy instantly to the web with Firebase Hosting.</li>
        <li>Secure data access with Firebase Auth and Firestore rules.</li>
        <li>Scale with confidence using Google infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>
