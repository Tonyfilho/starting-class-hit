    <h2>Understanding Dependency Injection</h2>
    <p>
      In Angular 19, <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> is a design pattern used to manage how components and services depend on one another.
    </p>

    <h3>üöö Analogy: A Transport Company</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a customer in Portugal orders a product from China. The customer receives the package at their door without knowing the entire logistics chain ‚Äî which courier picked it up, where it passed through, or how it got shipped. They just receive the package.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exactly how DI works in Angular: a component receives the necessary service without needing to know how it was created or where it came from. Angular handles the "logistics" of providing that service.
    </p>

    <h3>üí° Why is DI Useful?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Promotes loose coupling between classes</li>
      <li>Improves testability and reusability</li>
      <li>Makes your app more modular and easier to maintain</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üõ†Ô∏è How to Use DI in Angular</h3>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs look at a simple example of injecting a service into a component using DI.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-ts">// product.service.ts
{{"import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';"}}

{{"@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root'})"}}
export class ProductService {{"{"}}
  getProduct() {{"{"}}
    return 'üì¶ Product shipped from China!';
  {{"}"}}
{{"}"}}
</code></pre>

    <pre><code class="language-ts">// delivery.component.ts
import {{"{"}} Component {{"}"}} from {{'@angular/core'}};
import {{"{"}} ProductService {{"}"}} from './product.service';

{{"@Component"}}({{"{"}}
  selector: 'app-delivery',
  template: '{{ 'message' }}'
{{"}"}}
export class DeliveryComponent {{"{"}}
  message: string;

  constructor(private productService: ProductService) {{"{"}}
    this.message = this.productService.getProduct();
  {{"}"}}
{{"}"}}
</code></pre>

    <p>
      In the above code, <code>ProductService</code> is injected into the <code>DeliveryComponent</code> using the constructor. Angular automatically provides the instance of the service.
    </p>

    <h3>üîÑ Providing Services at Different Levels</h3>
    <p>
      Services can be provided at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Root level</strong>: shared across the whole app (<code>providedIn: 'root'</code>)</li>
      <li><strong>Component level</strong>: limited to that component and its children</li>
    </ul>

    <pre><code class="language-ts">{{"@Component({  selector: 'app-local-service',  providers: [LocalService]})"}}
</code></pre>

    <h3>‚úÖ Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Dependency Injection in Angular 19 is like a hidden logistics system ‚Äî it delivers services to components without exposing the creation logic. This improves your code's scalability, testability, and flexibility.
