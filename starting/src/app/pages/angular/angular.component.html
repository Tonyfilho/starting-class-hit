      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Angular</strong> is a powerful, open-source web application framework developed and maintained by
        <strong>Google</strong>.
        Originally released in 2010 as <em>AngularJS</em>, the framework was completely rewritten and relaunched as
        <strong>Angular</strong> (version 2+) in 2016 to support the development of large-scale, modern, and performant
        web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Angular is based on <strong>TypeScript</strong> and provides a complete ecosystem for building reactive,
        component-based user interfaces, integrated with tools for routing, HTTP communication, forms, animations, and
        much more.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Choose Angular?</h2>
      <p>
        Here are the main advantages that make Angular a top choice for building web applications:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full-featured Framework:</strong> Includes routing, forms, dependency injection, HTTP client,
          testing tools, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong> Promotes reusability, modularity, and testability of UI
          components.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Type Safety:</strong> Built on TypeScript, allowing early error detection and improved
          tooling support.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Way Data Binding:</strong> Syncs model and view automatically, reducing boilerplate code.</li>
        <li><strong>CLI Tooling:</strong> The Angular CLI simplifies project scaffolding, testing, and building.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Build for web, mobile (with Ionic), desktop (with Electron), and even
          native (with Angular + NativeScript).</li>
        <li><strong>Backed by Google:</strong> Enterprise-level support and a large community of developers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Angular vs Competitors</h2>
      <p>Hereâ€™s how Angular compares to other popular frameworks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Angular vs React:</strong> Angular is a complete framework, while React is a UI library that relies on
          third-party tools for routing and state management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Angular vs Vue.js:</strong> Angular offers more built-in features, while Vue is lighter and simpler
          but often requires additional plugins for advanced functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Angular vs Svelte:</strong> Svelte compiles at build time and offers simplicity, but Angular provides
          a more robust and scalable structure for large applications.
        </li>
      </ul>
